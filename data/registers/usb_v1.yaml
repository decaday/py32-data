# This is because USB registers are actually 8-bit, but the manual and SVD group registers as 32-bit.
#
# However, the Reference Manual mentions: 
# When writing to USB registers, operations can only be performed by byte or word,
# when reading USB registers, operations can only be performed by byte.
#
# Moreover, the SVD file contains some errors, and is almost undocumented.
